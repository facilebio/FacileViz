The purpose of this package is to provide helper functions to the facile.bio
ecosystem that produce javascript-based visualizations.

This should be considered an "internal" package and is not meant to be a general
and reusable plotting package. Currently it uses plotly internally for the
final plotting construct.

Useful functions found here:

* `fscatterplot` scatterplots with faceting
* `fboxplot` tried to implement grouped boxplots while supporting hover/jitter,
  we do this by leveraging the faceting approach
* `with_aesthetics`: Maps columns in a data.frame to aesthetics. We should rely
   more heavily on the scales package.
